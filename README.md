# 🌸 CatBoost Flower Classifier Web App

This is a simple web application built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that loads a pre-trained [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/) model to predict the type of flower based on user input.

The app supports real-time predictions and displays the corresponding **flower name** (e.g., Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) along with class probabilities.
